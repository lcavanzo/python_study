"""Validating if a chess dictionary position is valid"""

# takes a dictionary argument and returns True or False depending on if the board is valid.
## A valid board will have exactly one black king and exactly one white
## king. Each player can only have at most 16 pieces, at most 8 pawns, and
## all pieces must be on a valid space from '1a' to '8h'; that is, a piece canâ€™t
## be on space '9z' . The piece names begin with either a 'w' or 'b' to repre-
## sent white or black, followed by 'pawn' , 'knight' , 'bishop' , 'rook' , 'queen' , or
##'king' . This function should detect when a bug has resulted in an improper
## chess board.

# Entry example
##{'h1': 'bking', 'c6': 'wqueen','g2': 'bbishop', 'h5': 'bqueen', 'e3': 'wking'}
